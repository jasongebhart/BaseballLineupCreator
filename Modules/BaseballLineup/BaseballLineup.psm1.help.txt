    were on the bench in the previous inning or the current inning and players who have already been assigned
    to a position in the current inning. The result is a shuffled list of players available for the specified inning.
    
    .PARAMETER Innings
    An array of innings, each containing 'Player', 'Inning', 'Position', 'Jersey', 'PositionValue' and 'PositionNumber' properties.
    
    .PARAMETER TeamMembersList
    An array of players' names that are available for selection in the game.
    $teamMembersList = @("Player1", "Player2", "Player3", "Player4", "Player5", "Player6")
    
    .PARAMETER Start
    An optional parameter (default value is 1) representing the inning number for which players' availability needs to be determined.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    $innings = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{ Inning = 1; Player = $null; Position = "Bench One"; PositionValue = 0; PositionNumber = 10 },
    [PSCustomObject]@{ Inning = 2; Player = $null; Position = "Bench One"; PositionValue = 0; PositionNumber = 10 },

function Get-PitcherOfInning {
    <#
.SYNOPSIS
    Retrieves the pitcher for a specific inning from a collection of innings.

.DESCRIPTION
    The Get-PitcherOfInning function retrieves the pitcher for a specific inning from a collection of innings. 
    It takes a collection of innings as input and optionally allows specifying the inning number to search for a pitcher.
    If no pitcher is found for the specified inning, a warning will be displayed.

.PARAMETER Innings
    Specifies the collection of innings from which to retrieve the pitcher. This parameter is mandatory and accepts input from the pipeline.

.PARAMETER Inning
    Specifies the inning number for which the pitcher needs to be retrieved. This parameter is optional.
    If not specified, the function will default to searching for the pitcher in the first inning (Inning = 1).

.EXAMPLE
    $inningsData = @(
        [PSCustomObject]@{ Position = "Catcher"; Inning = 1 },
        [PSCustomObject]@{ Position = "Pitcher"; Inning = 1 },
        [PSCustomObject]@{ Position = "Outfielder"; Inning = 1 },

    This example retrieves the pitcher for Inning 2 from the given collection of innings data.

.INPUTS
    System.Object

    Accepts a collection of innings as input from the pipeline.

.OUTPUTS
    System.Object

    Returns the pitcher object found in the specified inning from the input collection of innings.
    If no pitcher is found, the function returns $null.

.NOTES
    The Get-PitcherOfInning function is intended to work with collections of innings, where each inning is represented as a custom object.
    The custom object should have "Position" and "Inning" properties, among others.

    Each custom object representing an inning should have a "Position" property specifying the player's position in that inning (e.g., "Pitcher").
    Additionally, each custom object should have an "Inning" property specifying the inning number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...).

    If there are multiple pitchers in the collection for the specified inning, the function will return the first one found.
